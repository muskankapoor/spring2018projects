* Notes
- Put your solutions in a folder named *lab_02*
- Each file must be named exactly as specified in the assignment
- Don't submit to Gradescope (we're not using it). Push to your repo
- Put the header comment in each program as specified in the
  assignment
- Make sure your program's input and outputs are *exactly* as
  specified in the assignment

* Changes to lab specification.
- Complete Task A as specified (keyboard input to test validation)
- For the rest of the tasks, instead of keyboard input put reasonable
  test cases in the main function so that when the program is run,
  it's clear that it works. For example, the main for
  print-interval.cpp might be something like:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    int main(){
      std::cout << "Interval from -5 to 5\n";
      print_interval(-5,5);
      // etc.
    }
  #+END_SRC
