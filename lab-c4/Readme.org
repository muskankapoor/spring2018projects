* Assignment Part 1
- Read the group spec all of the group after you (seven reads one)
- As a group, write up feedback for each specification (10 minutes).
  The key question is can you give this to a group of 3 programmers
  and can each of the three independently  work and then combine to
  make a final project. 
  - Compare it to how specified your projects and labs have been
    if it's much less detailed it's not a good spec.
  - Was it detailed enough to work  from? Why or why not.
  - Did it break things down for a group of 3?
  - Did it provide enough guidance from start to finish

* Assignment Part 2
- Spend 15 - 30 minutes individually implementing the project based on one
  spec.

* Assignment Part 3
- Re-evaluate the spec that you developed from now that you've spent
  some time trying to implement it.

* Deliverables 
- Make a repo under labs named lab-c4
- Place in it the code you wrote even if it's incomplete and doesn't
  compile by itepself.
- Create a Readme.md file. It should contain:
  - The names of people in your group.
  - The commentary for each spec you reviewed. Three Readme.md files
    for the three group members should collectively have all the
    reviews but it's not required to have all the reviews in all the
    README.md files.
- Email your reviews to the members of the other groups.
- redo your spec as a group before next Thursday and put it up in all
  of your lab-c4 repos. Name the new spec "newspec.md" or
  "newspec.org"
