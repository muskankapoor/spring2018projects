# Connect Four

## Game size
**Things to keep in mind:**

-Decide on Player Representations. Account for cheating and error. 

-Restrictions on correct matches (what qualifies as a winning match) and player restrictions. 

-Check if the space on the board has an input (i.e. multi-dimensional array)


## *Individial Tasks*


### **Person 1** 

-Make a function that creates the 4 by 4 board. 

-Make a function that appropriately updates the board's current values (in context with the game) Hint: You can take in the user's column and relative symbol (i.e. the player takes its turn).

### **Person 2**

-Design a function that checks for cheating in user input and ensures that the game is played in an alternating fashion between two players. 			

-Establish the game order (i.e. print board every time a move is made to show the changes occuring in the game) You may assume that the print board function and board characterization function already exists. 

### **Person 3**

-Design a function that calculates win conditions, determine and write what conditions are needed to keep the program running and/or to end it.
